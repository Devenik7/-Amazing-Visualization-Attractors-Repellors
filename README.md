# Attractors and Repellors

An Amazing Interactive Visualization created using the concept of Attractors & Repellors on Javascript.

The white dots are the attractors and the blue dots are the particles which will be attracted by the attractor if far but will be repelled by the attractor if came too close.

<b><i>Visit the Website and just click anywhere to place an attractor(white) for the particles to be attracted. Be quick though.</b></i>
